Hi there!

I am a recent Master of Mathematics graduate from the University of Melbourne, where I was supervised by [Diarmuid Crowley][crowley].
My thesis explored Split Polynomials, contributing to the study of the Sullivan Conjecture.
I am passionate about mathematical research, particularly in algebraic topology and its intersections with algebraic geometry.

Feel free to reach out at [tianqif@student.unimelb.edu.au][email].
