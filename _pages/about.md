Hi there!

I am a recent Master of Mathematics graduate from the University of Melbourne,
where I was supervised by [Diarmuid Crowley][crowley] and [Csaba Nagy][nagy] (University of Glasgow).

My [thesis][thesis] defines and explores an object called the Split Polynomials (originally introduced by [Csaba Nagy][nagy]),
relevant to the study of the Sullivan Conjecture (read more about this here: [`arXiv:2003.09216 [math.GT]`][crowley20]).
I am passionate about mathematical research, particularly in algebraic topology and its intersections with algebraic geometry.

Feel free to reach out at [tianqif@student.unimelb.edu.au][email].
