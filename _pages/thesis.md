My thesis defines and explores an object called the *split polynomials* (originally introduced by [Csaba Nagy][nagy]),
relevant to the study of the Sullivan Conjecture (read more about this here: [`arXiv:2003.09216 [math.GT]`][crowley20]).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Sullivan Conjecture posits the existence of complete intersections that,
  while distinct as complex manifolds, share the same underlying smooth structure.
  In order to study these complete intersections, we rely on an associated normal map,
  which is the data maps of the form $\gamma \to \gamma^{\otimes d}$, where $\gamma$ is a line bundle.
  We define the *split polynomials*, a monoid under composition formed by polynomials
  of the form $z \mapsto z^d$ on a one-dimensional subspace of a complex vector space.
  A *split polynomials* serves as a basic model for the behaviour observed on each fibre of the normal map.
  We then explore the structure of this split polynomial space and its quotient under the unitary group action,
  which we denote as the $\mathcal A$-space. While not the primary objective,
  we hope that we may gather evidence supporting the veracity of the
  Sullivan Conjecture through the study of these spaces.
